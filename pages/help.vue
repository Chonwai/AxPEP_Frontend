                Datasets are provided here for the purpose of reproducibility and future method
                testing. If you are looking for information about AMP sequences, you are recommended
                to visit other AMP databases such as ADP, CAMP, LAMP, etc. Our datasets here were
                collected from these databases and filtered out sequences with non-natural amino
                acids.
