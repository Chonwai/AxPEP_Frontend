                Datasets are provided here for the purpose of reproducibility and future method
                testing. If you are looking for information about AMP sequences, you are recommended
                to visit other AMP databases such as ADP, CAMP, LAMP, etc. Our datasets here were
                collected from these databases and filtered out sequences with non-natural amino
                acids.

                Data is filtered from our AmPEP dataset, include sequences only with 5-30 AA in
                length. This dataset is used for constructing the Deep-AmPEP30 and RF-AmPEP30
                prediction models. An independent dataset was constructed as benchmark to compare
                model performances with other existing methods.
